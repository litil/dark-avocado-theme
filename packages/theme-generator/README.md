# Theme Generator

This small project lets you generate colors configuration files to be used in themes. I needed to write this project because I wanted a way to easily regenerate the whole configuration file of my VSCode theme when I updated one single color.

## To-do

I'll start here with a VSCode generator script as this is what I need right now. More to come later on.

- [ ] Improve the color palette. Some colors are unused, others are not yet added to the palette.
- [ ] Update the theme to be perfect for React
- [ ] Update the theme to be perfect for Markdown
- [ ] Update the theme to be perfect for SCSS
- [ ] Update the theme to be perfect for JSON
- [ ] Read more about eye fatigue

## Supported Languages

- Typescript
- React
- Elixir
- SASS
- Markdown
- JSON
- Javascript
- HTML

I don't support some languages for now as I don't use them in a daily basis. I plan to support them later on though:

- PHP
- Python
- Powershell
- C++
- Go
- C#
- Ruby
- Less

## Things I changed from the original theme

- _yellow_ #addb67 => #a2e4b8
- _null_ #FF5874 => #ff5858
