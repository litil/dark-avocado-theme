# README

A Visual Studio Code theme for those spending looooooots of time coding either at night or on a low contrast screen. Fine-tuned for those of us who like to code late into the night. 

I tweaked the night owl theme to make it even more pleasant for those working daily on React projects, like me. For more information about this theme, check this (article)[https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/].
